# Memory-Game
It's a JS ES6 memory game with WEB API

The game made for practice JS ES6+ skills, such as async, await and callback functions.
In this project I worked with fetch API.

Probably this is not my best project so far, but I learnt so much from it.

I have a little issue what you can see in the console tab, I didn't find the aswere for it.

It's a little slow, but it's working if you don't want to clicking as fast as possible.

I learning in project based and I share all my project.

You can find bugs and broke the mechanism in functionality, but please don't do that, because it will be not enjoyable.
